# student-performance-visualization
Data Visualization project on student performance using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn.
📊 Student Performance Data Visualization Project
🔍 Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization on a dataset containing academic performance details of over 30,000 students. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, we uncover how various socio-economic, demographic, and personal factors influence student performance in Math, Reading, and Writing.

📁 Dataset Details
Source: Kaggle – Expanded Student Performance Data

Size: 30,000+ rows

Features:

Gender, Parental Education Level

Lunch Type (standard/free-reduced)

Test Preparation Course

Study Time, Siblings, Commute Time

Scores in Math, Reading, Writing

📈 Key Visualizations
Visualization	Insights Generated
Histograms	Score distribution across subjects
Box & Violin Plots	Outliers and score range comparisons by gender/lunch
Bar Plots	Average scores based on parental education & lunch type
Correlation Heatmap	Strong positive correlation between Reading & Writing scores

🧠 Insights
Female students perform better in Reading/Writing; males in Math.

Students who completed test prep courses consistently scored higher.

Standard lunch students outperform those on free/reduced lunches.

Parental education level positively correlates with student performance.

Strong subject interdependence: Reading ↔ Writing shows highest correlation (~0.88).
